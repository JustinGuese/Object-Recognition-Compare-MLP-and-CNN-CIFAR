# Object-Recognition-Compare-MLP-and-CNN-CIFAR
Comparing MLP and CNN (Efficientnet) for Object Recognition on the CIFAR 10 Dataset

I published this dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/scriptcontent/27396128/download 

In this notebook I explore the possibilities to do object recognition with the CIFAR 10 dataset. 
First I will show that classic MLPs do not work for this model and afterwards I will show how to implement a basic CNN. 

Finally I explore one of the best performing CNNs, namely the Efficientnet to achieve one of the highest scores reached on the CIFAR dataset.
